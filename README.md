## Overview of Project
Kickstarter Campaign Analysis for Louise
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show Louise, the client, how the category(Theater) performed based on launch dates for different projects, and how the subcategory(Plays) performed in relation to goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater Outcomes vs Launch](/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
In order to perform an analysis for Louise, I created a line chart that shows the total number of outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled) throughout the year for kickstarter campaigns, specifically for theater campaigns. Based on the line chart above, it appears that theater is a good source for kickstarter campaigns. The number of successful campaigns throughout the year surpass the number of failed campaigns, and the number of canceled campaigns seem to maintain a fairly low number. If we follow the successful line on the line chart, we can see that Theater campaigns tend to do well during the spring and summer months. A good uptick starts in April followed by a peak in May, where it starts to decline until August, which has pretty similar results to April. From the failed line we can see that failed theater campaigns tend to follow a similar pattern to successful campaigns, but don't vary as much throughout the year.

### Analysis of Play Outcomes Based on Goals

I also created a line chart depicting the success, failure, or cancellation percentage of theater campaigns, specifically plays, based on their funding goals. From the chart we can see that plays with lower goal funding ranges tend to succeed more than fail. The percent of failed plays seems to surpass the percent of successful plays when the goal range is 15,000 to 19,999 dollars. From that point the percent of failed plays continues to increase while the percent of successful plays continues to decrease as the funding goal range increases. A weird flip of successful percentages vs failed percentages occurs between the 35,000 to 34,999 dollars range and the 40,000 to 44,999 dollars range. After that it seems to flip again starting at the 45,000 to 49,999 dollars range where failed percentages are much higher than successful percentages. From this data we can see that canceled plays were not a factor in regards to funding goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I didn't seem to encounter any challenges or difficulties. Possible challenges that could have affected the data are too small of data sample sizes and possible outliers when extracting the data to analyze it. 

## Results
### Conclusions Made on Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Two conclusions I can make on Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date are that theaters tend to be very successful kickstarter campaigns, and that the best time to start that type of campaign is in the late spring/early summer months. May seems to be the best month for success.

### Conclusions Made on Play Outcomes Based on Goals
One conclusion I can make on Play Outcomes Based on Goals is that it is better to have a lower funding goal when using plays as a kickstarter campaign. The best chance for success is to have funding goals less than 5,000 dollars.  

### Limitations and Additional Table or Graph Recommendations
Possible limitations could be sample size or not enough tables, charts, or graphs. Other charts that could be created could be a chart that shows Outcomes Based on Location or individual charts Based on Subcategories(Plays, Musicals, Spaces).
